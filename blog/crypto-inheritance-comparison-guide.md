who gets your bitcoin if something happens to you? 

this isn't just a philosophical question—it's a technical one. in the digital asset space, "not your keys, not your coins" also means "no keys, no inheritance." 

as of 2026, four primary solutions have emerged to solve the <b>probabilistic finality of loss</b>. we’ve audited the technical architecture, cost, and trust models of the industry leaders to help you decide where to bury your secret.

### the contenders

1. **deadhand protocol**: an open-source, non-custodial threshold protocol using shamir's secret sharing.
2. **casa (inheritance)**: a multi-signature custody service focusing on hardware wallet coordination.
3. **unchained capital**: a financial services provider offering institutional-grade multi-sig vaults with legal inheritance support.
4. **sarcophagus**: a decentralized dead man's switch built on ethereum and arweave.

### technical side-by-side

| feature | deadhand protocol | casa | unchained | sarcophagus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **trust model** | zero-trust (non-custodial) | trusted facilitator | trusted custodian | decentralized (nodes) |
| **math core** | shamir's secret sharing | multi-sig (2-of-3) | multi-sig (2-of-3) | inner/outer encryption |
| **cost (annual)** | $100 (flat) | $250 - $5,000 | variable (asset fee) | tokenized (SARCO) |
| **kyc required** | no | yes | yes | no |
| **open source** | yes | partial | no | yes |
| **non-crypto use** | keys, passwords, files | bitcoin only | bitcoin only | encrypted files |

### 1. deadhand protocol: the sovereign choice

deadhand is built for users who want zero counterparty risk. by splitting a seed phrase into 3 shards and requiring any 2 for recovery, the protocol ensures that even if the deadhand servers are destroyed, you (and your beneficiary) can recover your assets entirely offline.

*   **best for**: sovereign individuals, privacy-conscious hnw individuals, and developers.
*   **the "alpha" edge**: it is the only protocol in this list that is fully self-hostable and requires no identity verification.

### 2. casa & unchained: the institutional gatekeepers

both casa and unchained provide high-end multi-sig setups. they are incredibly secure because they require multiple hardware keys to move funds. however, they operate as legal entities that require kyc.

*   **best for**: users who want a legal "hand-holding" experience and are comfortable with identity verification.
*   **the tradeoff**: your legacy is tied to their business solvency and compliance with local laws. if probate court freezes your identity, they may be forced to freeze your keys.

---

### 3. sarcophagus: the decentralized experiment

sarcophagus uses a network of node operators (archaeologists) who are paid in SARCO tokens to store your "dead man’s switch."

*   **best for**: web3 natives who want a purely on-chain solution.
*   **the tradeoff**: complexity. you must manage ether for gas, sarco tokens for nodes, and arweave for storage. if the token value crashes or the dao fails, the recovery nodes may go offline.

### the decision matrix: what happens when you die?

- **if you want no one to know you have crypto**: use **deadhand**.
- **if you want a lawyer to oversee the transfer**: use **unchained**.
- **if you have a large family and complex hardware wallets**: use **casa**.
- **if you are an on-chain purist**: use **sarcophagus**.

### conclusion

digital inheritance is no longer a luxury; it is a vital hedge against technical entropy. whether you choose the trustless mathematical path of <b>deadhand</b> or the institutional rails of <b>unchained</b>, the key is to act before the switch is forced.
