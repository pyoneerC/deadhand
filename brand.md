# Deadhand Protocol: Brand Guidelines
> "Make it look like a private bank run by cypherpunks."

---

## 1. Brand Essence

### Core Purpose
To solve the "Final Inactivity Problem." We ensure cryptographic wealth is never lost to entropy, death, or memory loss. We turn inheritance into a protocol, not a legal process.

### Vision
A future where sovereign individuals pass down wealth without relying on lawyers, banks, or the state.

### Values
*   **Sovereignty**: Not your keys, not your coins. Not your protocol, not your legacy.
*   **Permanence**: Build for 100 years, not the next cycle.
*   **Privacy**: We know nothing. We want to know nothing.
*   **Math > Trust**: Code is law. Humans are fallible.

### Personality: "The Silent Watchmaker"
*   **Stoic**: We don't hype. We don't panic.
*   **Understated**: True wealth whispers.
*   **Institutional**: We are the Swiss Vault in the digital age.
*   **Precise**: Every pixel and byte has a purpose.

## 2. Visual Identity

### The Aesthetic: "Impressionist Technocracy"
We reject the "neon/dark mode/3D coin" aesthetic of standard crypto.
We embrace **Classical Art** (Monet, Sisley, Renoir) juxtaposed with **Raw Code**.
*   **Why?** Art implies timeless value. Code implies modern security.

### Logo & Iconography
*   **Symbol**: The "Deadman's Timer" or "Broken Link".
*   **Favicon**: Simple, high-contrast monochrome.

### Color Palette
*   **Canvas (Backgrounds)**:
    *   `#FAFAFA` (Off-White) - Primary background. Institutional paper feel.
    *   `#FFFFFF` (Pure White) - Cards and focus areas.
*   **Ink (Text)**:
    *   `#111111` (Near Black) - Primary headings.
    *   `#333333` - Body text.
    *   `#666666` - Meta text / Secondary.
*   **Accents**:
    *   `#BC9C22` (Muted Gold) - Use sparingly for value/wealth.
    *   `#EF4444` (Signal Red) - Critical warnings (Dead man switch triggers).
    *   `#10B981` (Emerald) - Success states / Validations.

### Typography
The interplay between "Old Money" and "New Tech".

*   **Headings (The Voice)**: `Georgia, serif`.
    *   **Style**: **Lowercase only**. (e.g., `deadhand protocol`, `secure your legacy`)
    *   **Why**: Lowercase serif feels understated, confident, and editorial. It says "we don't need to shout."
*   **Body (The Content)**: `Georgia, serif` (Editorial) OR `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto` (App UI).
    *   *Web/Blog*: Georgia for reading flow.
    *   *App/Tool*: Sans-serif for data density.
*   **Data (The Proof)**: `Monospace` (`Courier New`, `Consolas`).
    *   Used for hashes, keys, shards, and technical terms.

## 3. Voice & Tone

### The Voice
Direct, low-time-preference, and slightly technical. Write like a cryptographer explaining high-stakes security to a wealthy friend.

*   **Avoid**: "Fast", "Easy", "Crypto", "To the Moon", "Profits".
*   **Use**: "Secure", "Sovereign", "Entropy", "Protocol", "Verification", "Legacy".

### Tone Examples

| Context | Do This | Don't Do This |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Landing Page** | "trustless inheritance for sovereign wealth." | "The easiest way to pass on your crypto!" |
| **Error Message** | "shard verification failed. check checksum." | "Oops! Something went wrong with your key." |
| **Email** | "deadhand heartbeat: require verification." | "Hey there! Just checking in!" |

### Key Rules
1.  **Lowercase Headings**: Always. It's our signature.
2.  **No Exclamation Marks**: Unless your house is on fire, don't use them.
3.  **Specific > Vague**: "AES-256 Encryption" is better than "Military Grade Security".

## 4. Imagery Guidelines

### The "Masterpiece" Strategy
For blog posts and feature headers, we use **Impressionist Oil Paintings**.
*   **Themes**: Nature reclaiming structures, clockwork in gardens, rivers, paths dividing.
*   **Vibe**: Melancholy but beautiful. "Memento Mori" (Remember death).
*   **Examples**:
    *   *Dead Man's Switch* → "Clockwork mechanism in a field of flowers" (Sisley style).
    *   *Inheritance* → "A lost key in a river bed" (Monet style).
    *   *Sharding* → "A tree splitting into three distinct paths".

### UI Graphics
*   Minimal line vectors.
*   No shadows, no gradients. Flat, technical diagrams.

## 5. Messaging & Positioning

### Taglines
*   "Don't let your crypto die with you."
*   "The final transaction."
*   "Friends don't let friends' crypto get lost."

### The "Sovereign" Pitch
> "Banks can freeze your accounts. Lawyers can lose your will. Deadhand is math. Math doesn't care who you are, it only cares if you are active."

### Target Audience
*   **The "Rich Bitcoin Uncle"**: Has >10 BTC. Worried about his kids losing it. Doesn't trust Coinbase.
*   **The Cypherpunk**: Wants to prove self-custody is viable even in death.
*   **The Paranoid**: Assumes the government is out to get them.

## 6. Usage Rules

### Logo Placement
*   Bottom center or Top left.
*   Always strictly monochrome (Black on White, or White on Black).

### "Do Not"
*   Do NOT use standard crypto "blue/purple" gradients.
*   Do NOT capitalize headings.
*   Do NOT use emojis in official protocol communications (docs/whitepaper).
*   Do NOT compromise on "Non-Custodial" messaging. We never hold keys.
