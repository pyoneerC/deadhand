## TITLE

**Your Clients' Bitcoin Will Outlive Them. Their Access Won't.**

---

## BODY

I need to tell you about a $140 billion problem that nobody in wealth management wants to discuss.

It's not market volatility.
It's not regulatory uncertainty.
It's not even custody risk.

**It's death.**

---

### The Math That Keeps Me Up at Night

4 million Bitcoin are already lost forever. Not hacked. Not stolen. Just... inaccessible.

The owners died. Or forgot. Or lost a piece of paper with 24 words on it.

At current prices, that's over $400 billion in digital wealth that will never move again.

And here's the uncomfortable truth: your clients are next.

---

### The Self-Custody Paradox

The entire value proposition of Bitcoin is sovereignty. "Be your own bank." No intermediaries. No counterparty risk.

But sovereignty creates a succession problem.

When your client holds their own keys, they become a single point of failure. The moment they stop breathing, their family's access to generational wealth depends on:

- A piece of paper in a fireproof safe (that they may have moved)
- A password manager (that requires a master password no one else knows)
- A lawyer (who doesn't understand the difference between a seed phrase and a private key)

I've seen families lose millions because Dad was "security conscious" and told no one.

### What Traditional Solutions Get Wrong

**"Just tell your spouse the password."**

This fails 90% of the time. Relationships change. Memories fade. Papers get thrown away during moves. And giving someone full access while you're alive creates its own risks.

**"Put it in your will."**

Wills are public documents. Filing a 24-word seed phrase with a probate court is like publishing your bank account credentials in the newspaper.

**"Use a multi-sig with your attorney."**

Now you're trusting a third party with signing authority over your client's assets. That's the exact counterparty risk crypto was designed to eliminate.

### The Solution: Trustless Inheritance via Shamir's Secret Sharing

At Deadhand Protocol, we solved this with math.

We split your client's seed phrase into 3 encrypted shards using **Shamir's Secret Sharing** (the same algorithm that protects nuclear launch codes).

Here's how it works:

- **Shard A**: Client keeps (in password manager or safe)
- **Shard B**: Beneficiary keeps (printed PDF, no digital exposure)
- **Shard C**: We hold encrypted (released only when triggered)

**Any 2 shards = full recovery. Any 1 shard = mathematically useless.**

Even if we're hacked, attackers get nothing useful. Even if the client is hacked, thieves get nothing useful. The threshold is the protection.

---

### The Dead Man's Switch

Every 30 days, we send your client a simple check-in email.

Click the link = timer resets.
Miss 3 consecutive check-ins = **Shard C is automatically released to the beneficiary.**

No lawyers. No probate. No courts. Just code.

The beneficiary combines Shard B (which they already have) with Shard C (which they just received), and recovers the seed phrase. They import it into any standard wallet and take custody of the assets.

**Time from trigger to access: 5 minutes.**

### Why This Matters for Your Practice

If you manage wealth for high-net-worth individuals with crypto exposure, you have a fiduciary problem you may not have considered:

1. **Liability**: If a client dies and their family can't access the assets, who do they blame?
2. **AUM Risk**: Dead clients don't generate fees. And neither do assets locked in inaccessible wallets.
3. **Reputation**: Being the advisor who "let" a family lose $10M in Bitcoin is not a referral generator.

Deadhand Protocol gives you a turnkey solution to offer your clients. It's:

- **Non-custodial**: You never touch their keys
- **Auditable**: Source-available code under AGPL v3
- **Compliant**: Works alongside existing estate planning (we handle access, lawyers handle title)

---

### The Bottom Line

Your clients chose self-custody because they don't trust institutions.

But self-custody without succession planning is just a delayed donation to the void.

**Don't let their sovereignty become their family's tragedy.**
