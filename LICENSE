WHY THIS MODEL?
================================================================================

We believe security software should be transparent. You should be able to verify
that your seed phrase is safe by reading the code yourself. However, building
and maintaining security infrastructure is expensive. This dual-license model
ensures:

1. TRUST: Anyone can audit the code
2. SUSTAINABILITY: The project can be maintained long-term
3. COPYLEFT: Forks must also be source-available under AGPL
